Input Fields: Text boxes for users to enter the amount they wish to convert and to select the source and target currencies.

Dropdown Menus: Comboboxes for selecting available currencies from a predefined list (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY).

Conversion Button: A button that, when clicked, triggers the conversion process based on the input values.

Output Display: A label or text area to show the converted amount and possibly the exchange rate used.

Layout: Organized using panels or layout managers (like GridLayout or FlowLayout) to ensure a clean and intuitive design.

Event Handling: Action listeners to respond to user inputs and button clicks, performing the conversion and updating the output display.

Error Handling: Notifications for invalid inputs or issues with conversion.

Overall, the GUI enhances user interaction and simplifies the conversion process in a visually appealing manner.
